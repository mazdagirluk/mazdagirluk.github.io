A Girl Scout leader in America
#momintech

### More Information

I started my career as a classic ASP developer, graduated to .NET developer/architect with SQL Server and MySQL.  Now I tinker with .NET and DataStax Enterprise.  I have this site to help my Girl Scouts learn and explore more in tech.

I first dabbled in HTML in 1997 with Geocities when I was in high school - over 20 years ago.  Hoping girls who start with some simple coding continue with it for years to come.
